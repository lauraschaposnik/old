After reading hundreds of children books with my sons, I decided to start writing and illustrating my own children books, in an attempt to combine this with my research and the educator inside me. You can see my work   related to   <a href="#ene">Ene's book series</a>, <a href="#raccoon">Raccoon's book series</a> and <a href="#azul">translation work</a> below.

<h1 id="ene">Ene and the Magic…  </h1>
 

Ene is a curious little mouse who explores magic places and discovers new worlds. Through the adventures of Ene, I hope to teach bilingual words (Spanish-English) on different topics. 
I am working on these books in collaboration with [Cecilia La Rosa](https://www.instagram.com/cecilialarosa.ilus/) (Illustrator).

<h1 id="raccoon">Raccoon's adventures  </h1>
 

Together with illustrator [Martina Rusznak](https://tinarusznak.com/) we are working on a couple of projects, the first one of which will lead to our first publication together coming mid 2022.

### Raccoon's difficult day

Our first book <b> Raccoon's difficult day</b> is a book about overcoming difficulties that one encounters daily, changing perspective to turn things our way, and building a <i>map to a better day</i> to be used next time a day seems to start in a difficult way.

## [Reaching for the stars (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1737058472/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_4P5WBNZJMAVM0E3M977K?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

 
My husband [James Unwin](https://unwin.people.uic.edu/James_Unwin.html) wrote his first children's book in 2021 titled  <b>Reaching for the Stars</b>,  illustrated by mathematician [Maylis Limouzineau](https://lucky8locke.ultra-book.com/). It is an engaging story about a cat that goes through several transformations on their journey to become a star in the sky. Children and adults will love to read and reread this beautiful illustrated tale featuring Cats, Tigers, Zebras and Reindeer. A thrilling journey of self-discovery that teaches children the importance of having the courage to follow their dreams and to become their best selves.

    </div>

I had the honor of translating the book to Spanish whilst preserving the beautiful rhyme, making the book available in Spanish and English, as well as in a bilingual version.
