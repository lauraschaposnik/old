	abstract={We create a novel Physarum Steiner algorithm designed to solve the Euclidean Steiner tree problem. Physarum is a unicellular slime mold with the ability to form networks and fuse with other Physarum organisms. We use the simplicity and fusion of Physarum to create large swarms which independently operate to solve the Steiner problem. The Physarum Steiner tree algorithm then utilizes a swarm of Physarum organisms which gradually find terminals and fuse with each other, sharing intelligence. The algorithm is also highly capable of solving the obstacle avoidance Steiner tree problem and is a strong alternative to the current leading algorithm. The algorithm is of particular interest due to its novel approach, rectilinear properties, and ability to run on varying shapes and topological surfaces.},

	abstract={Physarum polycephalum is a unicellular slime mold that has been intensely studied due to its ability to solve mazes, find shortest paths, generate Steiner trees, share knowledge, remember past events, and its applications to unconventional computing. The CELL model is a unicellular automaton introduced in the recent work of Gunji et al. in 2008, that models Physarum's amoeboid motion, tentacle formation, maze solving, and network creation. In the present paper, we extend the CELL model by spawning multiple CELLs, allowing us to understand the interactions between multiple cells, and in particular, their mobility, merge speed, and cytoplasm mixing. We conclude the paper with some notes about applications of our work to modeling the rise of present day civilization from the early nomadic humans and the spread of trends and information around the world. Our study of the interactions of this unicellular organism should further the understanding of how Physarum polycephalum communicates and shares information.},

The long distance approximation of such 7-branes is a Hitchin-like system in which simple and irregular poles emerge at marked points of the geometry. When multiple matter fields localize at the same point in the geometry, the associated Higgs field can exhibit irregular behavior, namely poles of order greater than one. This provides a geometric mechanism to engineer wild Higgs bundles. Physical constraints such as anomaly cancellation and consistent coupling to gravity also limit the order of such poles. Using this geometric formulation, we unify seemingly different wild Hitchin systems in a single framework in which orders of poles become adjustable parameters dictated by tuning gauge singlet moduli of the F-theory model.},

Since gauge theory is at the heart of our description of physical interactions, it has opened the door to the geometric engineering of many physical systems, and in particular those involving Higgs bundles.

Moreover, this study suggests that when individuals join members of the opposite sex there is a clear tendency to stop holding mobile phones whilst walking. Although it is not clear why people hold their phones whilst walking in such large proportions (38 percent of solitary women, and 31 percent of solitary men), we highlight several possible explanation for holding the device, including the need to advertise status and affluence, to maintain immediate connection with friends and family, and to mitigate feelings related to anxiety and security.},

Schaposnik as part of the “Geometry and Physics of Higgs Bundles” series which began in 2015 (and on several occasions co-organized by L. Anderson). The latest of these meetings was held at the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at Stony Brook University as part of a semester-long program on the “Geometry and Physics of Hitchin Systems” in Spring 2019, co-organized by L. Anderson and L. Schaposnik. The goal of these workshop series has been to bring together researchers at all career stages to address open problems and to introduce young researchers to a rich and complex field that spans diverse areas of mathematics and physics. In addition, it has been a goal of the workshops to highlight the important work being done by female and minority researchers in the field and the workshops were organized in cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics.},

	abstract={We introduce the notion of generalized hyperpolygon, which arises as a representation, in the sense of Nakajima, of a comet-shaped quiver. We identify these representations with rigid geometric figures, namely pairs of polygons: one in the Lie algebra of a compact group and the other in its complexification. To such data, we associate an explicit meromorphic Higgs bundle on a genus-g Riemann surface, where g is the number of loops in the comet, thereby embedding the Nakajima quiver variety into a Hitchin system on a punctured genus-g Riemann surface (generally with positive codimension). We show that, under certain assumptions on flag types, the space of generalized hyperpolygons admits the structure of a completely integrable Hamiltonian system of Gelfand-Tsetlin type, inherited from the reduction of partial flag varieties. In the case where all flags are complete, we present the Hamiltonians explicitly. We also remark upon the discretization of the Hitchin equations given by hyperpolygons, the construction of triple branes (in the sense of Kapustin-Witten mirror symmetry), and dualities between tame and wild Hitchin systems (in the sense of Painlevé transcendents).},

Recall that r-bootstrap percolation describes a deterministic process where vertices of a graph are infected once r neighbors of it are infected. We generalize this by introducing F(t)-bootstrap percolation, a time-dependent process where the number of neighbouring vertices which need to be infected for a disease to be transmitted is determined by a percolation function F(t) at each time t. After studying some of the basic properties of the model, we consider smallest percolating sets and construct a polynomial-timed algorithm to find one smallest minimal percolating set on finite trees for certain F(t)-bootstrap percolation models. },

	abstract={We introduce here a multi-type bootstrap percolation model, which we call T-Bootstrap Percolation (T-BP), and apply it to study information propagation in social networks. In this model, a social network is represented by a graph G whose vertices have different labels corresponding to the type of role the person plays in the network (e.g. a student, an educator, etc.). Once an initial set of vertices of G is randomly selected to be carrying a gossip (e.g. to be infected), the gossip propagates to a new vertex provided it is transmitted by a minimum threshold of vertices with different labels. By considering random graphs, which have been shown to closely represent social networks, we study different properties of the T-BP model through numerical simulations, and describe its implications when applied to rumour spread, fake news, and marketing strategies.},

We consider the effect of relaxing restrictions across less vulnerable age-brackets, comparing results across selected groups of varying population parameters. Moreover, we analyze the mitigating effects of vaccinations and examine the effectiveness of age-targeted distributions. Lastly, we explore how our model can applied to other states to reflect social-distancing policy based on different parameters and metrics.},

In the case of dendrites, Reiter's local two-dimensional model provides a realistic approach to the study of dendrite growth. In this paper we obtain a new geometric rule that incorporates interface control, a basic mechanism of crystallization that is not taken into account in the original Reiter model. By defining two new variables, growth latency and growth direction, our improved model gives a realistic model not only for dendrite but also for plate forms.},

	abstract={Since social interactions have been shown to lead to symmetric clusters, we propose here that symmetries play a key role in epidemic modelling. Mathematical models on d-ary tree graphs were recently shown to be particularly effective for modelling epidemics in simple networks. To account for symmetric relations, we generalize this to a new type of networks modelled on d-cliqued tree graphs, which are obtained by adding edges to regular d-trees to form d-cliques. This setting gives a more realistic model for epidemic outbreaks originating within a family or classroom and which could reach a population by transmission via children in schools. Specifically, we quantify how an infection starting in a clique (e.g. family) can reach other cliques through the body of the graph (e.g. public places). Moreover, we propose and study the notion of a safe zone, a subset that has a negligible probability of infection.},

	abstract={Large icosahedral virus capsids are composed of symmetrons, organized arrangements of capsomers. There are three types of symmetrons: disymmetrons, trisymmetrons, and pentasymmetrons, which have different shapes and are centered on the icosahedral 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold axes of symmetry, respectively. Sinkovits and Baker (2010) gave a classification of all possible ways of building an icosahedral structure solely from trisymmetrons and pentasymmetrons, which requires the triangulation number T to be odd. In the present paper we incorporate disymmetrons to obtain a geometric classification of large icosahedral viruses formed by regular penta-,tri-, and disymmetrons, giving all mathematically consistent and theoretically possible solutions. For every class of solutions, we further provide formulas for symmetron sizes and parity restrictions on h, k, and T numbers. We also present several methods in which invariants may be used to classify a given configuration},
